spu decompiler. sort of.
========================

This decompiles spu binaries (ELFs).

Right now it finds subroutines and all references between them.
It also tries to determine if a subroutine is reachable, but the problem of 
plain statical analysis is, that it doesn't find indirect calls to subroutines.
Next it builds the control flow graph for all subroutines and determines the edge types.

So please help me a little with this project :)
